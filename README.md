## Use
[Open this link](https://ethantilley.github.io/NN_GA_FlappyBird/) to see a live demo of the project!
To run this program, just open up the .html file.

## Why

I made this program to put the theory I've learnt into practice, familiarising myself with neural networks and better understand the genertic algoritim.

## Goals With This Program
- [ ] Stats display (high score, generation number, etc).
- [ ] Save best agent to json file to be brought back in.
- [ ] Neural network visualization.
